-- 🔍 CHECK 1: Find any duplicate Google IDs
-- (This should return 0 rows. If it returns data, those users are colliding.)
SELECT google_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM app_users 
WHERE google_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY google_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- 🔍 CHECK 2: Find any duplicate Emails
-- (Your unique constraint should prevent this, but it's good to verify.)
SELECT email, COUNT(*) 
FROM app_users 
GROUP BY email 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- 🔍 CHECK 3: Check for "NULL" ID issues
-- Ensure every user has a valid unique ID and no one is sharing a blank one.
SELECT id, email, username FROM app_users WHERE id IS NULL;
